VUE_APP_DEFAULT_CASE_DESCRIPTION="A 76-year-old man with chronic renal disease, renal obstruction, and a 10-year history of recurrent urinary tract infections was admitted to this hospital because of fever, worsening renal function, and confusion. The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1 week before admission, in midsummer, when subjective fevers and increasing urinary frequency developed. He contacted his physicians office; nitrofurantoin was prescribed, and he was advised to hydrate well. During the following week, there was partial improvement of his symptoms. He continued to be physically active until 2 days before admission, when fatigue and increasing somnolence developed. He slept most of the next day. In the evening, he appeared slightly confused and had difficulty placing a thermometer in his mouth. The temperature was 39.1C. He was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. Shortly after arrival, the patient became nauseated, with vomiting and progressive somnolence. On examination, the temperature was 38.5C, the blood pressure 142/48 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared confused and did not follow commands. The remainder of the examination was normal; the patient did not have slurred speech, and there were no focal neurologic findings. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and blood levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and lactic acid were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis reportedly revealed cloudy yellow urine, with a dipstick test showing moderate occult blood, a small amount of leukocyte esterase, protein 30 mg per deciliter, and no nitrites and sediment examination revealing 15 to 20 white cells and 10 to 15 red cells per high-power field, with occasional bacteria and epithelial cells. A chest radiograph reportedly was normal. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Computed tomography CT of the brain showed no evidence of an acute intracranial process. Vancomycin and ciprofloxa-cin were administered for possible urosepsis, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. After admission, the patient was noted to be persistently febrile, speaking incoherently, and unable to follow a conversation. Renal ultrasonography, in a limited study, reportedly revealed possible mild hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a cyst, 2.1 cm by 2.9 cm, in the left kidney. An indwelling Foley catheter was placed. Later that day, he was transferred to this hospital. Relatives reported that the patients perceived work of breathing and nonproductive cough had increased since admission to the other hospital. There was evidence of recent bilateral hydrone-phrosis, with worsening chronic renal failure blood level of creatinine, 2.9 mg per deciliter 260 mol per liter, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the prostate gland had revealed hypertrophy and inflammation. Two months before admission, photoselective vaporization of the prostate had been performed with a laser, after which the creatinine level decreased to 1.8 mg per deciliter 160 mol per liter. The patient had hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, and allergic rhinitis. He had had basal-cell carcinoma; he also had had orthopedic injuries, including chest-wall trauma and reconstruction, after a motor vehicle accident. Medications before admission included meto-prolol, nitrofurantoin, aspirin, and doxazosin. He was allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs. He was married and worked in an office. He lived in an urban area of New England and had recently visited a forested region of New England, which reportedly had heavy tick and mosquito burdens; his wife reported no known tick exposures. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His father and paternal grandfather had had heart disease, and his mother had died in her 30s of an intracerebral hemorrhage. On examination, the patient was warm, dia-phoretic, and obtunded, with nonverbal moaning. The temperature was 38.4C, the blood pressure 158/67 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 25 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing oxygen by nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The conjunctivae were injected. He was unable to follow commands or track his eyes in response to his name. A lesion on the right side of the tongue was consistent with a possible bite. His neck was stiff, without pain elicited on passive movement. Bronchial breath sounds throughout all lung fields obscured the heart sounds. Palpation of the right lower quadrant induced wincing; examination of the abdomen was otherwise normal. The extremities were warm and well perfused, without edema. Distal pulses were symmetric and normal. On neurologic examination, the pupils were 4 mm in diameter and constricted to 3 mm with light. Extraocular movements were difficult to assess, but they appeared intact, without nystagmus. Pinching the right arm induced grimacing, pinching the right great toe induced minimal withdrawal of the right leg, and there was no response to pinching the left arm or leg. Move-ment of all limbs was otherwise nonpurposeful and spontaneous. The tone was increased in the arms, with cogwheel rigidity and myoclonus. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and lactic acid and results of coagulation and liver-function tests; other results are shown in Table 1. Review of a peripheral-blood smear revealed thrombocytope-nia. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, yellow urine with a pH of 5.5 and a specific gravity of 1.015. The urine had trace ketones, 2 occult blood, and 2 protein and was positive for leukocyte esterase; there were 3 to 5 red cells, few white cells, few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field and 10 to 20 granular casts and mucin per low-power field. An electrocardiogram showed ventricular bi-geminy, at a rate of approximately 100 beats per minute, but a true ventricular rate of 55 beats per minute; the native QRS complex was narrow, without a prolonged PR interval. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and increased opacity at the left lung base, which were thought to represent atelectasis, pneumonia, or pleural fluid. A lumbar puncture was performed, requiring multiple attempts because of the patients rigidity and movement; results of cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood, sputum, urine, and CSF were cultured. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: CT of the brain performed without the administration of contrast material revealed mild, nonspecific periventricu-lar hypoattenuation. There was no evidence of an acute intracranial process. An extraaxial mass 9 mm in greatest dimension that was consistent with a meningioma was noted overlying the left sylvian fissure. Dr. Goldstein: Ceftriaxone, meropenem, and acyclovir were administered. During the second night, the patient became increasingly tachypneic and required increasing suction to clear his airway. He was transferred to the intensive care unit ICU, and the trachea was intubated for airway protection. CT of the abdomen revealed moderate bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter, findings that were not changed from studies 2 months earlier. Dr. Gonzalez: The next day, magnetic resonance imaging MRI and magnetic resonance arteri-ography revealed a small amount of material with restricted diffusion layering in the occipital horns of the right and left lateral ventricles Fig. 1, which was thought to be most consistent with purulence and ventriculitis. The mass noted previously was visualized, with no evidence of infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, or a hemody-namically significant intracranial arterial lesion. Dr. Goldstein: During the next 3 days, episodes of hypertension to more than 200 mm Hg systolic occurred and were treated with labetalol; propofol was administered for respiratory efforts in dyssynchrony with the mechanical ventilator. On the seventh day, diagnostic test results were received."
